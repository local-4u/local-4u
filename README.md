Gov Hack 2020 Project 
Theme - Responding to pandemic, Caring for the elderly. 
We built an utility app for the regional NZ, an app where you can get access to all the essential services during a pandemic/ non pandemic situation aimed specifically at the elderly.

The main feature of the app is a chatbot.
- when the user is above 60 or requires any special assistance, the app become voice controlled. 
It also regulates news and sends alerts from Regional government hence avoiding fake news.  

The tools used are 
Python,
R-shiny
AWS Transcribe 
MySQL database
NLP library for extractibg keywords
Word2Vec embeddings for recommending results.
