Gov Hack 2020 Project 
Theme - Responding to pandemic, Caring for the elderly. 
We built an utility app for the regional NZ, an app where you can get access to all the essential services during a pandemic/ non pandemic situation aimed specifically at the elderly.

The main feature of the app is - when the user is above 60 or requires any special assistance, the app become voice controlled. 
It also regulates news and sends alerts from Regional government hence avoiding fake news.
